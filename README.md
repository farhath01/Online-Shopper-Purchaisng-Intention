# Online-Shopper-Purchaisng-Intention
The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period.  Out of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping. The goal is to predict which user will end up buying something from the portal.
Your job is to first apply exploratory analysis on each dataset. Randomly split each dataset into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). Then, apply each of the following algorithms to learn a model from the training set and classify the examples in the test set. 
	•	SVM 
	•	k-Nearest Neighbor 
	•	Decision Tree
